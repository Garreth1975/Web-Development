Outgoing Chief of Staff John Kelly admitted the White House gave up on building a concrete border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border 'early on' in President Donald Trump's administration but said some 'fencing' was necessary.

'To be honest, it's not a wall,' he told the Los Angeles Times in a long interview defending his rocky tenure atop Trump's White House.

'The president still says 'wall' - oftentimes frankly he'll say 'barrier' or 'fencing,' now he's tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it,' he said.Cekcu
